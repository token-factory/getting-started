## Demo
Including in this base project are demo and examples for Token Factory and Stellar.    The demo script seeds the Token Factory deployment with a collection of Stellar Accounts and transactions in the form of a user scripted demo.   We have used this demo flow for simple demo walk throughs and discussions as well as used it to prototype API and UI features.
