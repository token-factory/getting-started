# Token Factory

## Mission

Token Factory mission is to enable enterprises to issue and manage asset-backed tokens on one network.

- Stellar token support: issue, distribute, trade, and redeem asset-backed tokens
- Exchange integration: an exchange(s) to support asset trading
- Business user interfaces: issue, distribute, trade, and redeem asset-backed tokens without coding

## Projects
### dashboard

### registration-service
The `registration-service` project is a basic user management service.
### token-service
The `token-service` project is a lightweight GraphQL API service that interacts with the Stellar network
### gql-proxy

### build-service
The `build-service` project is the `deployer` project for Token Factory.


## Demo
Including in this base project are demo and examples for Token Factory and Stellar.    The demo script seeds the Token Factory deployment with a collection of Stellar accounts and transactions in the form of a user scripted demo.   We have used this demo flow for simple demo walk throughs and discussions as well as used it to prototype API and UI features.
